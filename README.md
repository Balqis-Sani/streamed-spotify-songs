# OBSERVATIONS 

Highest and Lowest Streams by Year:
The year 2023 recorded the highest number of music streams, showcasing the growing popularity and accessibility of streaming platforms in recent times. In stark contrast, the year 1940 had the lowest number of streams, which can be attributed to several factors. During that period, digital platforms like Spotify were nonexistent, and music consumption was primarily through physical media such as vinyl records, radio, or live performances. Additionally, limited awareness of modern streaming technologies and a lack of digital infrastructure in earlier years further widened this disparity.

Top Artists by Year and Overall:
SZA emerged as the top artist in 2022, gaining significant recognition and popularity for her music that resonated with a broad audience. In 2023, Taylor Swift led as the most-streamed artist, reaffirming her global appeal and ability to adapt to evolving musical trends. When considering all years combined, from 1940 to 2023, Taylor Swift holds the title of the overall top artist. This underscores her consistency, longevity in the industry, and the enduring connection she has maintained with listeners over the years, solidifying her as a music icon across multiple generations.

Dominant Streaming Method:
The major mode was identified as the primary method of music streaming, reflecting its widespread adoption by listeners. This preference for the major mode could indicate the popularity of specific genres or musical styles that resonate most with the audience. Additionally, the accessibility and convenience of streaming platforms may have influenced this trend, as users gravitate toward methods that offer seamless and engaging listening experiences.

 

# RECOMMENDATIONS

Boost Streaming Numbers Through Awareness and Engagement:
To maintain and increase streaming numbers, the company should focus on expanding its reach to untapped markets where awareness of streaming platforms is still limited. This can be achieved through targeted advertising campaigns and promotional activities in such regions. For example, running ads on local media, collaborating with influencers, or offering free trials could encourage more people to explore the platform. Additionally, creating curated playlists featuring older music, organized by decades or genres, could attract audiences interested in music history. This initiative could serve both educational and entertainment purposes, encouraging a broader range of listeners to engage with the platform.

Leverage Top Artists for Audience Engagement:
The company can capitalize on the popularity of top artists like Taylor Swift and SZA by creating specialized playlists that showcase their music evolution over the years. These playlists could be paired with exclusive content, such as behind-the-scenes stories, artist interviews, or "Top Artist Highlights," which provide listeners with unique insights into the artistsâ€™ journeys. Additionally, organizing virtual events, such as live-streamed performances or Q&A sessions with these artists, can further drive listener engagement and boost platform loyalty. Such efforts not only celebrate the achievements of these artists but also create an emotional connection with fans, encouraging them to use the platform more frequently.

Enhance the Primary Streaming Mode:
To ensure the primary streaming method remains the preferred choice, the company should focus on improving its user experience and sound quality. This could involve investing in advanced audio technology to deliver high-definition sound that appeals to audiophiles and casual listeners alike. Simplifying the user interface to make navigation more intuitive and introducing customizable features, such as personalized playback settings, could also enhance user satisfaction. Furthermore, providing detailed user tutorials or tips on how to maximize the streaming experience can make the platform more accessible to new users, fostering long-term engagement and loyalty
